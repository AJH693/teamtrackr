Project Trackr
==============

Project Trackr is a web application which can be used to track progress of software project. The application will allow teams to input a list of tasks at the start of their project. These tasks are not required to have code to complete them. 

Once an initial task have been inputted, the project estimation will be locked and future changes will be prevented (unless explicitly allowed by the admin). The application will tally up the metrics in each of the teamâ€™s tasks in order to come up with totals for the entire project. Then, throughout the project, each team will update the tasks they have completed along with any metrics associated with each task. 

## Laravel PHP Framework

1. install composer with the following command: `php composer.phar install`

2. Now you should be able to start the local server: `php artisan serve` (runs your server at http://localhost:8000)

3. Before you can log in or create an account on the website you need to set up a mysql database named teamtrackr on your local machine:

	- Start Mysql

	`mysql`<br>

	`CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';`<br>

	- Provide the user with access to the information they will need.
	
	`GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'newuser'@'localhost'`;<br>

	- Once you have finalized the permissions that you want to set up for your new users, always be sure to 	reload all the privileges.

	`FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`
	</br>

4. In /app/configure/database.php, update the mysql array with your correct database information.
5. Run: `php artisan migrate` This will populate the database with all the tables that you need.
